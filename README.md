# Learning how to code with a little help from Leonhard.

These scripts illustrate the journey from novice to (semi)-master of python through the mini math/programming projects that are part of a repository of super interesting puzzles. Some of the code is terrible, some of the code is alright, and some of the solutions are even a little clever. All of the work to initially solve these problems was my own although there are a few examples where I refined my solutions with the help of the discussion boards and solutions that were extra clever. I solve these problems in no particular order and often get stuck on one and move on to others before getting struck by a moderately underwhelming lightning bolt of wisdom.

This repository is not meant to be used for people to just copy solutions and solve the problems. Don't be a douche and just copy the code to boost your PE score. Since I have been using this to learn to code, most of the initial scripts are somewhat terrible so you're not really doing yourself a favor anyways. Also, it is meant for people that actually enjoy solving these problems... (Spoiler alert: It counts for nothing and if you're not actually doing your own work than whats the point?).

If by some miracle of god you have stumbled on this page and are completely stuck on a problem (I mean there are plenty of better options for hints) then I hope you can try to learn from my mistakes and press on with solving problems. Like the rat from Ratatouille, I think that anyone can code if they put forth enough time. Just Keep Solving!
